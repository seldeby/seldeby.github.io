<h1> Yellowstone National_park </h1>
<br>
<p> <b>Yellowstone National Park </b> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_park"> national park </a> located primarily in the U.S. state of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming"> Wyoming </a>, although it also extends into <br>
Montana and Idaho. It was established by the U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant on March 1, 1872- <br>
Yellowstone was the first National Park in the U.S. and is also widely held to be the first national park in the world.<br>
The park is known for its wildlife and its many geothermal features, especially Old Faithful Geyser, one of its most popular features.<br>
It has many types of ecosystems, but the subalpine forest is the most abundant. It is part of the South Central Rockies forests ecoregion. <br> </p>
<p>Native Americans have lived in the Yellowstone region for at least 11,000 years. Aside from visits by mountain men during the early-to-mid-19th century, <br>
organized exploration did not begin until the late 1860s. Management and control of the park originally fell under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Interior,<br> the first being Columbus Delano. However, the U.S. Army was subsequently commissioned to oversee management of Yellowstone for a 30-year period between 1886 and 1916.<br>
 In 1917, administration of the park was transferred to the National Park Service, which had been created the previous year. <br>
Hundreds of structures have been built and are protected for their architectural and historical significance, and researchers have examined more than 1,000 archaeological sites.
